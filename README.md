# Rover-Stream
Part of my Robot Army development - this project is to manage the streaming of data to-from the rover.

Why??  because I want the primary 'output' of the rover to be a Live Stream and visible to anyone that wants to watch what the rover is doing.  This will allow for a broader audience to follow along the rover's journey.
Also part of Why? the goal is to provide a very simiple interface to the Rover.  This would allow any potential viewer to suggest commands to the rover via the 'live Chat' feature of the streaming service.
